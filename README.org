A sweet build of Fedora with the Cinnamon desktop.
* Features
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: installation
  :END:
- Uses Cinnamon as the default DE.
- Tries to strike the perfect balance between security and performance.
- Stable by default.

Though, it must be noted that the distribution tries to be as bleeding edge
as possible while being as stable as possible. 
A lot of changes that have been approved for next versions of Fedora 
may be enabled here. You can read the "Enabled Features" section to see
what is enabled.

* Installation

  :CUSTOM_ID: installation

** Rebasing
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rebasing
   :END:
- To begin, you'll need to switch to the unsigned image to install the
  necessary keys. You can do this by running the following command:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/hikarineee/rolls:latest
  #+END_SRC

- And then rebooting your system with:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  systemctl reboot
  #+END_SRC

- Afterwards, you can switch to the signed image:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/hikarineee/rolls:latest
  #+END_SRC

- And finally, reboot your system again with:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  systemctl reboot
  #+END_SRC

** ISO
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: iso
   :END:
- An ISO image can be built using the following command for offline installation.
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo podman run --rm --privileged \
    --volume .:/build-container-installer/build \
    --security-opt label=disable --pull=newer \
    ghcr.io/jasonn3/build-container-installer:latest \
    IMAGE_REPO="ghcr.io/hikarineee" \
    IMAGE_NAME="rolls" \
    IMAGE_TAG="latest" \
    VARIANT="base" \
    VERSION="40"
  #+END_SRC
Replace "rolls" with "rolls-nvidia" and "base" with "base-nvidia" if trying to generate an ISO for the nvidia
variant.

** Post Install
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: post-install
   :END:
Optionally, you can set up some custom kernel parameters using:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rpm-ostree kargs --append="tsc=reliable cryptomgr.notests intel_iommu=igfx_off kvm-intel.nested=1 no_timer_check noreplace-smp page_alloc.shuffle=1 rcupdate.rcu_expedited=1 rw"
#+END_SRC

These parameters are taken from the [[https://www.clearlinux.org/][Clear
Linux]] project. You can read more about these parameters from
[[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.1/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html][here]].

It is also recommended to install homebrew.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
just brew
#+END_SRC
