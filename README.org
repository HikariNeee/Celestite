** Rebasing
   :PROPERTIES:

   :END:
- To begin, you'll need to switch to the unsigned image to install the
  necessary keys. You can do this by running the following command:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/hikarineee/celestite:latest
  # if you want the nvidia variant
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/hikarineee/celestite-nvidia:latest
  #+END_SRC

- And then rebooting your system with:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  systemctl reboot
  #+END_SRC

- Afterwards, you can switch to the signed image:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/hikarineee/celestite:latest
  # if you want the nvidia variant
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/hikarineee/celestite-nvidia:latest
  #+END_SRC

- And finally, reboot your system again with:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  systemctl reboot
  #+END_SRC

** ISO
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: iso
   :END:
- An ISO image can be built using the following command for offline installation.
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo podman run --rm --privileged \
    --volume .:/build-container-installer/build \
    --security-opt label=disable --pull=newer \
    ghcr.io/jasonn3/build-container-installer:latest \
    IMAGE_REPO="ghcr.io/hikarineee" \
    IMAGE_NAME="celestite" \
    IMAGE_TAG="latest" \
    VARIANT="base" \
    VERSION="40"
  #+END_SRC
Replace "celestite" with "celestite-nvidia" if trying to generate an ISO for the nvidia
variant.

** Post Install
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: post-install
   :END:
Optionally, you can set up some custom kernel parameters using:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rpm-ostree kargs --append="tsc=reliable cryptomgr.notests intel_iommu=igfx_off kvm-intel.nested=1 no_timer_check noreplace-smp page_alloc.shuffle=1 rcupdate.rcu_expedited=1 rw"
#+END_SRC

These parameters are taken from the [[https://www.clearlinux.org/][Clear
Linux]] project. You can read more about these parameters from
[[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.1/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html][here]].

* Switching the theme
If you want to switch the theme, you can do so using the Themes application.
However, some apps, notably Software will show up with the previous theme, to fix this.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir "${HOME}/.config/gtk-4.0"
ln -sf /usr/share/themes/Lavanda-Sea-Dark/gtk-4.0/gtk.css "${HOME}/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css"
ln -sf /usr/share/themes/Lavanda-Sea-Dark/assets  "${HOME}/.config/gtk-4.0/assets"
ln -sf /usr/share/themes/Lavanda-Sea-Dark/gtk-4.0/gtk-dark.css  "${HOME}/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk-dark.css"
#+END_SRC

Replace Lavanda-Sea-Dark with theme you use as well as make sure the links 
(notably, assets) point to actual folders in the theme you use.
